Hello there! ðŸ‘‹<br />

A passionate web developer with a strong affection for Python programming. I've been actively working on building real-world projects using Django and am continuously learning more about web development to refine my skills.<br /><br />

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications, where I specialized in C, Java, and Python. This academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in programming principles and problem-solving techniques. In addition to my formal education, I have completed an online course on Artificial Intelligence with Python. Through this course, I've gained valuable insights into data analysis and visualization using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.<br /><br />

On my GitHub profile, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase my journey and growth as a developer. Each repository reflects my dedication to building impactful solutions and my enthusiasm for learning new technologies.<br /><br />

I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities. If youâ€™re looking for someone with a passion for web development and a strong background in Python, or if you simply want to discuss technology and collaborate on exciting projects, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m available via fidhumusthafa3549@gmail.com or on
